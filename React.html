        <h1 id="styles" align="center">REACT</h1>
        <h1 id="styles" align="center">React is a JavaScript library that aims to simplify the development of visual interfaces.</h1>
        <font id="styling">Developed at Facebook and released to the world in 2013, it drives some of the most widely used code in the       world.<br> It powers Facebook and Instagram among many, many other software companies.
            Its primary goal is to make it easy to reason about an interface and its state at any point in time by dividing the UI into a collection of components.<br>
            React is used to build single-page web applications, along with many other libraries and frameworks that were available before React came to life.</font>

        <h1 id="styles" align="center">Why is React so popular?</h1>
            <h1 id="styles" align="center">React has taken the frontend web development world by storm. Why?</h1>
            
            <font id="styling">
                Less complex than the alternatives
                At the time when React was announced, Ember.js and Angular 1.x were the predominant choices for frameworks. Both of these imposed too many conventions on the code so that porting an existing app was not convenient at all.
                React was created to be very easy to integrate into an existing project.<br> That’s how they had to do it at Facebook in order to introduce it to the existing codebase. Also, those two frameworks brought too much to the table, while React only chose to implement the View layer instead of the full MVC stack.</font>

            <font id="styling"><u>Perfect timing</u>
                At that same time, Angular 2.x was announced by Google, along with the backwards incompatibility and major changes it was going to bring. Moving from Angular 1 to 2 was like moving to a different framework. And so this fact, along with the execution speed improvements that React promised, made React something developers were eager to try.

                <u>Backed by Facebook</u>
                Being backed by Facebook benefits a project if it turns out to be successful. But it’s not a guarantee, and there are many failed open source projects by both Facebook and Google (among others).</font>

            <h1 id="styles" align="center">Is React really that simple?</h1>
            <font id="styling"> Even though I said that React is simpler than alternative frameworks, diving into React is still complex. This is mostly because of the corollary technologies that can be integrated with React, like Redux, Relay or GraphQL.<br>React in itself has a very small API.</font>



            <h1 id="styles" align="center">There isn’t much more in React other than these concepts:</h1>
            <font id="styling">(1)Components<br>
                (2)JSX: Many developers, including myself, at first sight thought that JSX was horrible, and quickly dismissed React.

                Even though they said JSX was not required, using React without JSX was painful.

                It took me a couple years of occasionally looking at it to start digesting JSX, and now I largely prefer it over the alternative (that is, using templates).

                The major benefit of using JSX is that you’re only interacting with JavaScript objects, not template strings.

                JSX is not embedded HTML<br>
                (3)State<br>
                (4)Props<br></font>


            <h1 id="styles" align="center">React Components</h1>
            <font id="styling">What is a React Component?
                A component is one isolated piece of the interface. For example, in a typical blog homepage, you might find the Sidebar component and the Blog Posts List component. They are in turn composed by components themselves, so you could have a list of Blog post components, each for every blog post, and each with its own peculiar properties.</font>
